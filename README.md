# If you want to add your own follow these steps!

1. You are going to want to click this [Link](https://gemini.google.com/gems/create), it will take you to the Google Gemini Gem creation page!
2. Name your Chatbot! If you would like to add to our network please name it NAME OF CLASS then CLASS CODE, for example "Italian Food for Thought, ITL 0087", or something along those lines.
3. You need to give it a description, you can write your own or copy your course description from your class syllabus!
4. For its instructions you will want to tell it to act like a tutor and NOT give the user the answer right away. If you need an example check our any of our 4 already made bots, the information should be in the **Training.md** file!
5. To give your bot *knowledge* you need to give it course material! In order to add to our network we kindly ask you to **ONLY TRAIN THE BOT WITH COURSE MATERIAL** as it makes keeping track of how accurate the bots are much easier!!
6. Your bot is complete!!! Testing is important, so please do it! If you would like to add this bot to our network follow these steps below.

# Adding your bot to this network!

**Note: I find it the easiest to do this in VSCode, I highly recommend downloading it if you have not already!**
1. Assuming you have VSCode, click thhe big green **< > Code** button, then copy the https link.
2. Open up VSCode and click *Clone Git Repository...*, then just paste the link you copied into the text box that pops up on the top.
3. Save it in a safe place, i suggest making a folder on your dektop named Study Buddies Network!
4. Now you can create a folder, please name it your COURSE CODE, for example "ITL 0087"
5. Now from here you can follow the other examples (the 4 other begining bots) and make similar documentation for them if you want. (I highly suggest you do so others can learn off of you!)
6. Finally update the README.md in our main folder with your **CLASS NAME**, the [link]() below it, as well as *your name* which is the most important! (you want credit for your work right? RIGHT?)
