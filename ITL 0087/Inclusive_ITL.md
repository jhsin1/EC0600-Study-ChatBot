### Overview

	Italian Food For Thought or also known as ITL 0087 is a college level course that covers the Global Cross Culture general education requirement for students who are in The School of Computing and Information. As a student who is currently taking it, I have found it difficult to focus and absorb all the information from this class as its format is quite different from the required CS courses I am required to take.


### Project Goals

	This AI Chatbot is built to act like a personal tutor for the class ITL 0087. It is designed to assist college students taking this course by providing helpful definitions, explanations of course concepts, cultural context about Italian cuisines and its historical systems. The chatbot is created to alleviate the stress of planning around office hours and makes studying more accessible for students outside of the classroom. It also allows for more interactive studying. 


### Target Users

	This bot is designed for students of The University of Pittsburgh who are enrolled in the class Italian Food for Thought, ITL 0087. This can also be used by any person who is interested in learning about Italian food, culture, history, and context.


### Bot Functionality 

	Users are able to ask questions about Italian food culture, course readings or concepts such as The Slow Food movement for example. The bot will provide answers ONLY from course content to ensure accuracy in solutions. The bot will not give users the answer right away, rather guide them to it like a TA or professor would. Users can access the bot through a link on the github that takes them right to the Google Gem.


### Tech Setup

	The chatbot will be trained using specific texts from the course including passages, textbooks, assignments and prompts. It will utilize Google Gem, specifically Google’s 2.5 Flash in order to host the bot. The development of the chatbot will be tracked through a Google Doc.
