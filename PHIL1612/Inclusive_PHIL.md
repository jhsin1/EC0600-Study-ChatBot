Overview
Philosophy of 20th Century Physics, PHIL 1612 is a college level course that goes over all the philosophical theories and theorists that make up what we currently know about Physics.

Project Goals
This AI Chatbot is built to act like a personal tutor for the class PHIL 1612. It is designed to assist college students taking this course by providing helpful definitions, explanations of course concepts, accurate background information about theories and theorists.The chatbot is created to alleviate the stress of planning around office hours and makes studying more accessible for students outside of the classroom. It also allows for more interactive studying.

Target Users
This bot is designed for students of The University of Pittsburgh who are enrolled in the class Philosophy of Physics, PHIL 1612. This can also be used by any person who is interested in learning about the philosophical background surrounding what we know about Physics.

Bot Functionality
Users are able to ask questions about the philosophical aspects of Physics, course readings or theories such as The Many Worlds theory for example. The bot will provide answers ONLY from course content and the textbook to ensure accuracy in responses. The bot will not give users the answer right away, rather guide them to it like a TA or professor would. Users can access the bot through a link on the github that takes them right to the Google Gem.

Tech Setup
The chatbot will be trained using specific texts from the course including passages, textbooks, assignments and prompts. It will utilize Google Gem, specifically Google’s 2.5 Flash in order to host the bot. The development of the chatbot will be tracked through a Google Doc.
